## About me
I am enrolled in graduate program in **Computer Science** at **Arizona State University** anticipated to graduate in **May 2020**. I am open to opportunities as in *Software Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Analytics, Machine Learning Engineer* starting July 2020. Given any opportunity in research, my research interests lies in the field of **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**.

I completed my Under-graduation program at **Charotar University of Science and Technology, India** in the field of **Information Technology**. It is very pleasing to share that I ended up being **Gold Medalist** at my university during under graduate program.

Apart from my academics, I always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. I love creating application which tend to change the world. My mission-driven work ethic helps me to keep my focus strong and make a big impact at high growth company. I always try to solve problems which are tricky to solve. I have done many academic projects in the field of Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I look to challenge myself further more to dive deep into these fields by creating more projects independently.
